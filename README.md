# KTH-Advanced-Machine-Learning-2016-Assignment-1
This is a compilation of my solution for assignment 1 in KTH's Advanced-Machine-Learning-2016 course. All the codes were done in python and mathematical derivation are written in Latex.

Check the pdf "Assignment01_ph" for the questions and "Assignment01sol" for the solutions. You may also need to refer the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop in some questions.

Description:
In this assignment we will examine several different aspects of building models of data. In the
first task we will look at a supervised scenario where we work with a model of a specific relationship
between two different domains. This is a very common problem where we have observations in one
domain, say an image of a face and then wish to infer the identity of the person. The second task
we look at how we can perform unsupervised learning and learn a new representation of the data.
This is related to finding hidden structures or patterns in the data which might contain important
information. Finally we will end with a look at how we can approach model selection. This is
very important as it gives us the tool to design different models and then choose the one that best
represents our data. The important message that these exercises tries to convey is how we can
integrate our beliefs with observations using a set of simple rules. The assignments are aimed at
showing the key aspects of data modeling in a simple scenario such that our insights about the
models are not ”clouded” by the complexity data.
