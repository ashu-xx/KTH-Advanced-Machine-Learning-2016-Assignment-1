# KTH-Advanced-Machine-Learning-2016-Assignment-1
Machine Learning
The project includes Linear regressions, Variational Inference and Expectation Maximization as well as mathematical derivations for some of them. This is a compilation of my solution for assignment 1 in KTH's Advanced-Machine-Learning-2016 course. All the codes were done in python and mathematical derivation are written in Latex.

Check the pdf "Assignment01_ph" for the questions and "Assignment01sol" for the solutions. You may also need to refer the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop in some questions.
